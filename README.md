**ImageFetcher App**

This app is used to test ImageCacheLibrary(https://github.com/threadLord/ImageCacheLibrary)

1. App has *ImageListView* where all downloaded images are listed.
   - On the bottom of the view there is a horizontal stack
   - On the left hand side you can find a button that removes the cache from the app
   - On the right hand side you can find a button that reloads images
   - If you want to test reset cache, scroll down to the bottom(because we use LazyVGrid), tap on the Remove cache button, than on the reload button

2. To use App properly follow these steps:
   - Go to File -> Packages -> Reset Packages Caches
   - Go to File -> Packages -> Update to Latest Packages Versions
